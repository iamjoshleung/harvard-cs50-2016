# CS50 2016

Harvard CS50 is a course I took in 2016 on [EDX.org](https://www.edx.org/) as a challenge. 

I have finished all the assignment and checked the answers. 

This course is highly recommended if you are interested in Computer Science. It's fun and intellectually stimulated and is a good introduction to computer programming.
